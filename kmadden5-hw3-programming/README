README

I ran the programs on Python3 and would recommend that for better visualizations, however, they will also run on Python2.

Question 1:
Call python kmadden5-hw3-1.py in the command line - this will run the file and generate a scatter plot graph.
You can specify which graph you would like to make by commenting or uncommenting the different starting centroids in the file itself.

Question 2:
Call python kmadden5-hw3-2.py in the command line - this will run the file and generate a scatter plot graph.

Question 3:
Call python kmadden5-hw3-3.py in the command line - this will run the file and generate three scatter plots as required.

Notes:
Each file is self-sufficient and runs independently in the command line to generate the necessary scatter plots to answer the questions.
The scatter plots are automatically saved as PNG files with names associated with the question numbers (ex. "scatter-3-1" for the first plot for the third question).
The algorithms contained in each file are all slightly different versions of the same core kmeans algorithm, since the number of clusters and the distance measurement differs.
